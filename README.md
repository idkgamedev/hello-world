# hello-world
My first repository. I'm following a GitHub tutorial
I am 14. I've been learning JavaScript for about 3 years. I also know C# and I'm currently learning Unity. Thanks to Dani for inspiring me. Milk gang all the way. Also, thanks to Brackeys for mentoring me. It's been good. i'm planning on working on Discord bots some day. Anyway, that's about it.
